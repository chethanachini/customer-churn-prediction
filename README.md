# customer-churn-prediction
Customer churn prediction identifies customers likely to stop using a service. Businesses use data and machine learning to detect churn early and take action to retain customers. High churn rates cause revenue loss. This project aims to build a predictive model to identify at-risk customers and help businesses retain them. The extensional System of this system analyzes past customer data, transactions, and interactions to predict churn trends by using decision tree algorithm. The drawback of using a Decision Tree is Overfitting. The propositional system in this case is the Random Forest Classifier, a machine learning model used for customer churn prediction. It builds multiple decision trees on customer data and combines their outputs to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. The dataset includes demographics, subscription details, usage patterns, support interactions, billing history, and churn labels. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Feature importance highlights key churn factors. Churn prediction helps businesses retain customers and reduce losses. Machine learning models enable proactive strategies for customer retention and long-term growth.
